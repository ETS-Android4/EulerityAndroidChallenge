# EulerityAndroidChallenge
A simple image editor that I made for my Android Developer internship application to Eulerity.

 1. Fetches and displays a list of images from a url
 2. Allows users to browse and edit images using filters, text overlays, stickers, emojis, and more
 3. Allows users to save their finished image or upload it to a website using a POST request
